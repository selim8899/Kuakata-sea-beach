                    <p>Bangladesh is a dreamland of bewitching natural beauty and ‘Kuakata’ (Bengali: কুয়াকাটা), locally known as ‘Sagar Kannyat’ Daughter of the sea, has contributed a lot to her beauty. This rare scenic tourist spot is situated in Latachapli Union under Kalapara Police Station of Patuakhali district. Kuakata beach is a sandy expanse 18 kilometers (11 mi) long and 3 kilometers (1.9 mi) wide. From the beach, one can have an unobstructed view of both sunrise and sunset over the Bay of Bengal. It is 70 km from Patuakhali District Headquarters and 320 km from Dhaka. The phenomena that have made Kuakata a fantasy kingdom arresting the attention of the tourists of home and abroad are its picturesque natural beauty, sandy and foamy beaches, blue sky, evergreen forest, shimmering and rippling vast water of the Bay of Bengal, fishing boats plying in the sea with colorful sails, the surfing waves, migratory birds, the unending line of coconut trees, hundred-year-old Buddhist temples, age-old traditional cultural life of the Rakhaines, religious festival’s of different communities, etc. The sunrise, the sunset, the sunbath, diving and swimming in the sea are some special attractions of this spot. In fact, as a paradisiac virgin beach, this second important tourist spot of the country plays a vital role in tourism and the economy of Bangladesh. On the eastern end of the beach is Gongamati Reserved Forest, an evergreen mangrove forest and snippet of the original Kuakata. As a mangrove forest, Gongamati, like the Sundarbans, offers some protection against tidal surges. However, it too is being threatened by logging and deforestation. The best way to reach the forest is by foot or bike along the beach, where flag-flying fishing boats can be seen trawling the coast. Visiting Gangamati in the late afternoon is a perfect time to watch the sun cast shadows on the exposed mangrove roots. However, the government should adopt all possible measures to develop the communication and transport system along with other modern amenities with a view to seeing Kuakata as a class-one tourist spot in Bangladesh.</p>
